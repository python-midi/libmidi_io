# libmidi_io

[![PyPi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/libmidi_io)](https://pypi.org/project/libmidi_io/)

MIDI I/O utils.

This additional libmidi package adds basic MIDI I/O support (like mido.ports does). It provides a base abstract MIDI port class with some utils (input and output support being consolidated into one class). It still lacks a lot of features (TCP/IP remote ports, backends, etc), which will be rewrote from scratch with time.

Requires Python 3.8 or greater

## Installation

```sh
pip3 install libmidi_io
